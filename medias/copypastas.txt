This is me. This is the shape that let others recognize me as myself. It is my symbol for myself. This is, this is, and this is as well. Representations.

Oh senpai, hey! I didn't know you walked this way. We're right in front of your house? I-I wasn't looking or anything, I just happened to be walking by! It'd be creepy to know where you live, s-stupid! What was I walking by for? OKAY! I had to give you something!

I just go into a match and that's it. But my aim, it's comes from more than just a game. For me - aim - it is about precision... This part people don't see. This part, it does not show up in highlights. When I sit down to play everything already is a part of me...
